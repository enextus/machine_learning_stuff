Thanks for using PlaidML!

The feedback we have received from our users indicates an ever-increasing need
for performance, programmability, and portability. During the past few months,
we have been restructuring PlaidML to address those needs.  To make all the
changes we need to make while supporting our current user base, all development
of PlaidML has moved to a branch â€” plaidml-v1. We will continue to maintain and
support the master branch of PlaidML and the stable 0.7.0 release.

Default Config Devices:
   llvm_cpu.0 : CPU (via LLVM)

Experimental Config Devices:
   llvm_cpu.0 : CPU (via LLVM)

Using experimental devices can cause poor performance, crashes, and other nastiness.

Enable experimental device support? (y,n)[n]:y

Selected device:
    llvm_cpu.0

Almost done. Multiplying some matrices...
Tile code:
  function (B[X,Z], C[Z,Y]) -> (A) { A[x,y : X,Y] = +(B[x,z] * C[z,y]); }
Whew. That worked.

Save settings to C:\Users\Teilnehmer.BBQTEIL-HV16HBF\.plaidml? (y,n)[y]:y
Success!
